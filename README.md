** This app was being hosted only for demonstration purposes, but some people found it online and started using it to redirect to malicious websites, therefore as of right now,  it's offline to prevent those activities.

## About this project
The main idea was to have a simple tool in which users can input a long URL and instantly get a shorter one that points to the same place.

They also have the option of specifying a custom slug, for which, instead of getting a random generated one, they will have full access to that custom slug forever.
